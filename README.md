## Anticipated Questions:

### About FakeForce:
#### Which files do I need if I want to use this in a real project?
The only files you will need for a real project are the src/classes with the *F45_* prefix.

#### What do the file prefixes mean:
* F45 - FakeForce
* SAMP - Sample

#### Why F45?
Because I like bad puns.

#### How can I learn more about this project?
Read the source code.
Also -- just for you -- I've included some useful commentary in the otherwise clean source code.
